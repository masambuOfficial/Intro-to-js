//oop - object oriented programing with js
// Why??
// 1. supports code reuse
// What is involved? 
// we are dealing with classes and object
// What is an object? It is an instance of a class - these the copies of Invitation Cards
// What is a Class? It is a blueprint of object - Is the original invitation card

// let us use the analogy of an invitation card;
// when you design the original invitation card and print it, it relates to the class then the copies you make out of that card relates to object

// How to identify a class?
// we use a phrase "is a"
// a class specifies pproperties of an object
// sub-classes:

//Toyota - Class
// Toyota Vitz is a sub-class
// Inheritance - sub-class sharing properties of a super-class
// Abstraction - level of representation
